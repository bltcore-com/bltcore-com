### Marc Greenberg - Director of Software Strategy (The DSS)
and sometimes a fractional CTO/Tech Consultant

I drive change and lead innovative projects. I am eager to take on any new challenge that allows for broad strategic influence and collaboration. I seek to contribute to an organization with a bold vision where I can apply my expertise in scaling engineering teams, delivering transformative customer experiences, and leveraging technology to unlock growth. # bltcore-com
